# Cryptobot

# Design

- Consistency is the most important
- File and folder names lowercase
- Variable names snake_case
- Class names PascalCase

# Code Structuring

- Functions in Alphabetical order
- Separate code as much as possible

# To Do

 - Extended logging on exceptions, lines, file, etc...
 - more user-defined config values (take profit %, etc.)
 - multiple accounts (one account per docker container) - done but no automatic generation of containers from database

# only X86 or arm 64 bit
