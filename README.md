# Cryptobot

# Design

- Consistency is the most important
- File and folder names lowercase
- Variable names snake_case
- Class names PascalCase

# Code Structuring

- Functions in Alphabetical order
- Separate code as much as possible

# To Do

 - Logging to files
 - Add extra verbose logging on each step
 - Extended logging on exceptions, lines, file, etc...
 - more user-defined config values (take profit %, etc.)
 - multiple accounts (one account per docker container) - done but not yet automatic generation of containers from database
 - automatic checking of isolated wallets for trace amounts of coins that need to be transfered
 - automatic conversion of small amounts to bnb ( and possibly to card )
